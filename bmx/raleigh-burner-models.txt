2007 25th Anniversary Team Aero Pro (White/Team Colours, White Skyway Tuff IIs, No pads) modern re-issue of the 1985-6 Tange/Koizumi classic but with cheaper modern parts
2007 Boxfresh Burner (Chrome/Black with spotty “superchrome” layer over, black Skyway Tuff IIs, Boxfresh padset)
2008 Mag Burner (White/Black re-issue of the 1985 Mk II mag burner, first issue had Black Skyway Tuff IIs, later replaced with cheaper mags)
2008 SuperTuff Burner (Gold/Black re-issue of the 1984 Mk II ST burner, first issue had Black Skyway Tuff IIs, later replaced with cheaper mags, gold colour is a yellower gold than the lovely pale gold superchrome of the original)
2010 Tuff Burner (Blue/Yellow re-issue of the iconic 1982 Tuff Burner)
2017 35th Anniversary Team Aero Pro (White/Team Colours, White Skyway Tuff IIs, team padset included). All new modern re-issue of the 1985-6 Tange/Koizumi classic, this time with better overall geometry and much better bars, branded reproduction parts (Tange (Taiwan) frame, DC brakes and hinged seat clamp, Kashimax/Raleigh seat etc). Easy way to tell a 35th frame is the 3 holes on the rear dropouts being very different to both the original and the 25th.
